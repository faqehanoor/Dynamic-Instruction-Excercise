## ✨ Exercise 1: Medical Consultation Assistant (Intermediate)  

🩺 The agent adapts tone instantly depending on the user type:  

- **Patient** → Simple, reassuring language.  
- **Medical Student** → Moderate medical terms + explanations.  
- **Doctor** → Full medical terminology, concise & professional.  

> Example:  
> *"Don’t worry, high BP just means pressure is a little high"*  
> → *"Hypertension is persistently elevated arterial blood pressure."*
